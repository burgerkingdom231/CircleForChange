# CircleForChange
A Cycle of Change is a nonprofit working to keep girls in school by ending period poverty. Around the world, millions of girls miss classes each month because they lack access to safe, affordable menstrual products. Over time, this can lead to falling behind, dropping out, and losing opportunities for a better future.
